	  	<h3>Project 1 - Interview/Survey and Corpus Analysis</h3>
	  		<h4>Purpose</h4>
	  			<p>The purpose of this project is to learn about the various digitial literacies of a technical communicator. To this end, you'll use two main data sources for this project: 1) Interview or survey of at least three practicing technical communicators and 2) a corpus analysis of technical communication job ads. You will have three weeks to complete this project.</p>
	  		<h4>Requirements</h4> 
	  			<ul>
	  				<li><b>Interview or Suvey</b> - For this project, you must conduct an interview or a survey. While I don't really care what you ask your participants, there are a few key questions I'm concerned with. In addition to these four questions, you must add AT LEAST 2 more questions. 
	  					<ol>
	  						<li>What are their most used tools?</li>
	  						<li>What is their definition of digital literacy and how does it relate to their jobs?</li>
	  						<li>What is the most important technical skill they possess?</li>
	  						<li>How valuable is being able to teach yourself new technical skills?</li> 
	  					</ol>
	  				</li>
	  				<li><b>Corpus Analysis</b> - We will create a corpus of technical communication job ads together as a class. You will analyze this corpus using AntConc software. There you will look for patterns in the job ads. You should be looking for the following patterns: 
	  					<ol>
	  						<li>What are the most frequently used keywords and phrases for job titles in the corpus?</li>
	  						<li>What are the most frequently used keywords and phrases for job descriptions?</li>
	  						<li>What are the most frequently used keywords and phrases for required skills?</li>
	  					</ol>
	  				</li>
	  			</ul>
	  		<h4>Deliverables</h4>
	  			<ol>
	  				<li>Findings Report - A report of your findings that are synthesized into a 3-5 page report. This means that I do not want you to simply report all of the results from your research. Instead, use the report to describe key themes. Break the report into the following sections: 
	  					<ul>
	  						<li>Introduction</li>
	  						<li>Method (SHORT description of your method)</li>
	  						<li>Key findings from Interview/Survey</li>
	  						<li>Key findings from corpus analysis</li>
	  						<li>Compare/contrast findings</li>
	  						<li>Reflect and discuss key takeaways. (What was surprising and why? How will this knowledge impact technical communicators?)
	  					</ul>
	  				</li>
	  				<li>Contact information for your interview/survey subjects. Also, provide how you contacted the participant (email, phone, in person) and how long you interacted with the participant.</li>
	  				<li>7-10 minute presentation. I will not tell you what to present because you are graduate students. Make it interesting, know your audience, and impress us all.</li>
	  			</ol>
	  		<h3>Project 2 - XML Database and HTML Transformation</h3>
	  			<h4>Purpose</h4>
	  				<p>The purpose of this project is to introduce you to source literacies in technical communication. You will work with data at all phases for the data lifecycle. This includes 1) marking up raw data (XML), 2) processing the data (XSLT), and 3) outputting the data in a usable format (HTML/CSS) then You will be required to markup a dataset (of your choosing) in XML. You will then be required to transform the XML into an HTML table or list using XSLT. Finally, you'll be required to apply minimal styles to the table using CSS.</p>
