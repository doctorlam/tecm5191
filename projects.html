	  	<h3>Literacy 1 - Primary Research and Data Analysis (Interview/Survey and Corpus Analysis)</h3>
	  		<h4>Purpose</h4>
	  			<p>The purpose of this project is twofold: 1) to learn about the various digitial literacies of a technical communicator 2) to learn to conduct and apply primary research. To this end, you'll use two main data sources for this project: 1) Interview or survey of at least three practicing technical communicators (faculty and former graduates of UNT are not allowed) and 2) a corpus analysis of technical communication job ads. You will have three weeks to complete this project.</p>
	  			<p>This project will last 3 weeks. Plan accordingly.</p>
	  		<h4>Requirements</h4> 
	  			<ul>
	  				<li><b>Interview or Suvey</b> - For this project, you must conduct an interview or a survey. While I don't really care what you ask your participants, there are a few key questions I'm concerned with. In addition to these four questions, you must add AT LEAST 2 more questions. 
	  					<ol>
	  						<li>What are their most used tools?</li>
	  						<li>What is their definition of digital literacy and how does it relate to their jobs?</li>
	  						<li>What is the most important technical skill they possess?</li>
	  						<li>How valuable is being able to teach yourself new technical skills?</li>
	  					</ol>
	  				</li>
	  				<li><b>Corpus Analysis</b> - We will create a corpus of technical communication job ads together as a class. You will analyze this corpus using AntConc software. There you will look for patterns in the job ads. You should be looking for the following patterns: 
	  					<ol>
	  						<li>What are the most frequently used keywords and phrases for job titles in the corpus?</li>
	  						<li>What are the most frequently used keywords and phrases for job descriptions?</li>
	  						<li>What are the most frequently used keywords and phrases for required skills?</li>
	  					</ol>
	  				</li>
	  			</ul>
	  		<h4>Deliverables</h4>
	  			<ol>
	  				<li>Findings Report - A report of your findings that are synthesized into a 4-7 page report. This means that I do not want you to simply report all of the results from your research. Instead, use the report to describe key themes. Break the report into the following sections: 
	  					<ul>
	  						<li>Introduction</li>
	  						<li>Method (SHORT description of your method)</li>
	  						<li>Key findings from Interview/Survey</li>
	  						<li>Key findings from corpus analysis</li>
	  						<li>Compare/contrast findings</li>
	  						<li>Reflect and discuss key implications. (What was surprising and why? How will this knowledge impact technical communicators? How will this knowledge impact your future in the profession?)
	  					</ul>
	  				</li>
	  				<li>Contact information for your interview/survey subjects. Also, provide how you contacted the participant (email, phone, in person) and how long you interacted with the participant.</li>
	  				<li>5-7 minute presentation. I will not tell you what to present because you are graduate students. Make it interesting, know your audience, and impress us all.</li>
	  			</ol>
	  		<h4>Grading Criteria</h4>
	  			<ol>
	  				<li><b>Quality of insights drawn from interview/survey</b>: You will be graded on how well you synthesized and drew inferences from the responses from your participants. Synthesis means that you've found distinct patterns in the data and drew conclusions from those patterns. Your insights can be "obvious", but they should reflect thoughtful contemplation and analysis.</li>
	  				<li><b>Quality of insights drawn from corpus analysis</b>: You will be graded on how well you synthesized and drew inferences from the corpus data. Synthesis means that you've found distinct patterns in the data and drew conclusions from those patterns. Your insights can be "obvious", but they should reflect thoughtful contemplation and analysis.</li>
	  				<li><b>Writing quality</b>: Technical communicators are writers at heart. As such, you'll be graded on grammar, style, visual design, and genre conventions. If you aren't sure how to structure a formal report, research it.</li>
	  				<li><b>Visual Design</b>: Your report must be designed in a compelling way without the use of an exisiting Microsoft Word template. This is not a design class, so we won't cover how to design. However, this is a graduate program in technical communication, so you should know how to design/layout a professional report.</li>
	  				<li><b>Genre</b>: You'll be graded on whether your report meets the criteria for a formal IMRaD report genre. If you don't know what this is, please research it and apply your writing accordingly.</li>
	  				<li><b>Quality of presentation</b>: You'll be graded on your presentation style and content. The style should reflect thoughtful planning. The content should reveal a thoughtful analysis and general interest in the topic.</li>
	  			</ol>
	  		<h3>Literacy 2: Source Code and single sourcing (XML, Single Sourcing, and HTML Transformation)</h3>
	  			<h4>Purpose</h4>
	  				<p>The purpose of this project is to introduce you to source literacies in technical communication. You will work with data at all phases for the data lifecycle. This includes 1) marking up raw data (XML), 2) processing the data (XSLT), and 3) outputting the data in a usable format (HTML/CSS) then You will be required to markup a dataset (of your choosing) in XML. You will then be required to transform the XML into an HTML table or list using XSLT. Finally, you'll be required to apply minimal styles to the table using CSS.</p>
	  				<p>This project will last 4 weeks. Plan accordingly.</p>
	  			<h4>Deliverables and Requirements</h4>
	  				<ol>
	  					<li><b>XML database file</b>: You'll be required to create a well-formed, fully validated, XML database file with a minimum of 20 full entries (20 parent nodes). Feel free to work with a larger dataset though. It is your responsibility to select a dataset. If you are having trouble, it is your responsibility to meet with me during my office hours.</li>
	  					<li><b>XSLT stylesheet</b>: You are required to create a well-formed, XSLT stylesheet that renders the XML file in a browser as an HTML table. You may research how to do this and/or alter existing solutions you find. If you choose to alter an existing solution, you'll be asked to defend and explain your XSLT choices to ensure you understand what the code is doing.</li>
	  					<li><b>CSS stylesheet</b>: You are required to style your HTML table using a CSS file. You must include a minimum of 5 CSS styles. I don't care what you do to the table, but here's some suggestions: alternate row shading, remove table borders, change fonts, change spacing between cells, etc.</li>
	  					<li><b>Reflection paper</b>: A 500-750 word reflection paper of your experience with this project. Be sure to include rationale for your tagging system and hierarchy. Also, discuss explicit rationale about why your tagging/hierarchy meets specific user needs. Because your are in graduate school, I trust you can determine what to else include and I won't provide you with an explicit outline. Your effort counts here (i.e., I'm looking for beautiful and well-written documents that technical communicators should be able to create)</li>
	  				</ol>
	  			<h4>Extra Credit Opportunities</h4>
	  				<p>Because this is a digital literacy course, you are encouraged to learn and apply technical knowledge on your own. As such, you can be awarded up to 10 additional points on the project. These opportunities are for students who have a strong handle on HTML/CSS/XML/XSLT and feel comfortable exploring on their own. </p>
	  				<ol>
	  					<li><b>Sortable Table (1-5 points)</b>: Implement javascript into your table to make the columns sortable. You may use existing solutions. However, you'll be asked to defend or explain those solutions</li>
	  					<li><b>Full HTML Transformation (1-5 points)</b>: While you're not required to transform your XML into an HTML page, you have the opportunity to earn extra credit by using a programming language (javscript is probably easiest. HINT: see W3Schools for a template) to create an actual .html page from your XML database.</li>
	  					<li><b>Additional HTML/CSS (1-5 points)</b>: You have the option to integrate your HTML table into a larger HTML page. For instance, you can add a full-blown header, nav bar, footer and put the table into the page.</li>
	  				</ol>
	  			<h4>Grading Criteria</h4>
	  				<ol>
	  					<li><b>Well-formed XML</b>: Your XML is well-formed and logical. It must have a tree structure and be fully-validated. See W3Schools for an XML validator.</li>
	  					<li><b>Well-Written XML</b>: Your XML database contains semantic tags that are logical and clearly describe the content for which you are marking up.</li>
	  					<li><b>XSLT is fully-functional</b>: Your XSLT works and outputs your dataset into an HTML table. It contains correct syntax and is properly formatted.</li>
	  					<li><b>Well-written CSS</b>: CSS applies at least 5 styles to your HTML table. It is well-written and fully validated. </li>
	  					<li><b>Quality of reflection paper.</b>: You'll be graded on grammar, style, and visual design of your reflection. Additionally, your paper should reflect thoughtful contemplation.</li> 
	  					<li><b>Your best effort</b>: You put forth your absolute best effort to complete this project, regardless of your prior coding experience. You exhibited a clear effort in reseraching and applying knowledge on your own.</li>
	  				</ol>
	  		<h3>Literacy 3: Data-driven Audience analysis, information architecture, information design (Creating a knowledge base)</h3>
	  			<h4>Purpose</h4>
		  			<p>For this assignment, you will create a knowledge base for IT-related information for freshman students at UNT. The knowledge base must be delivered in an online format. You will work in teams of two to complete this project.</p>
		  			<p>As part of the project, you'll be required to conduct primary research by interviewing and/or surveying freshman students at UNT. Based on this research, you will create an audience profile and an initial set of items for your knowledge base.</p>
	  				<p>This project will last approximately 6 weeks. Plan accordingly.</p>

	  			<h4>Deliverables and Requirements</h4>
	  				<ol>
	  					<li>Primary research documents (e.g., copies of interview questions and answers, survey questions and answers, etc.)</li>

	  			<h3>Literacy 4: Tool Acquisition (Persuasive Guide)</h3>
	  				<h4>Overview</h4>
	  				<p>For this project, you are asked to create a guide (online or in print) for technical communicators for a tool that you have never used. Part of the project will be conducting primary and secondary research to identify the tool. You will create a guide that outlines the purpose, application, and relevant procedural information for technical communicators. The guide should also be persuasive in that it should clearly convince a technical communicator to adopt the tool for their own work.</p>
	  				<p>This project will last approximately 3 weeks. Plan accordingly.</p>
