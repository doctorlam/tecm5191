	  	<h3>Project 1 - Interview/Survey and Corpus Analysis</h3>
	  		<h4>Purpose</h4>
	  			<p>The purpose of this project is to learn about the various digitial literacies of a technical communicator. To this end, you'll use two main data sources for this project: 1) Interview or survey of at least three practicing technical communicators and 2) a corpus analysis of technical communication job ads. You will have three weeks to complete this project.</p>
	  		<h4>Requirements</h4> 
	  			<ul>
	  				<li><b>Interview or Suvey</b> - For this project, you must conduct an interview or a survey. While I don't really care what you ask your participants, there are a few key questions I'm concerned with. In addition to these four questions, you must add AT LEAST 2 more questions. 
	  					<ol>
	  						<li>What are their most used tools?</li>
	  						<li>What is their definition of digital literacy and how does it relate to their jobs?</li>
	  						<li>What is the most important technical skill they possess?</li>
	  						<li>How valuable is being able to teach yourself new technical skills?</li> 
	  					</ol>
	  				</li>
	  				<li><b>Corpus Analysis</b> - We will create a corpus of technical communication job ads together as a class. You will analyze this corpus using AntConc software. There you will look for patterns in the job ads. You should be looking for the following patterns: 
	  					<ol>
	  						<li>What are the most frequently used keywords and phrases for job titles in the corpus?</li>
	  						<li>What are the most frequently used keywords and phrases for job descriptions?</li>
	  						<li>What are the most frequently used keywords and phrases for required skills?</li>
	  					</ol>
	  				</li>
	  			</ul>
	  		<h4>Deliverables</h4>
	  			<ol>
	  				<li>Findings Report - A report of your findings that are synthesized into a 3-5 page report. This means that I do not want you to simply report all of the results from your research. Instead, use the report to describe key themes. Break the report into the following sections: 
	  					<ul>
	  						<li>Introduction</li>
	  						<li>Method (SHORT description of your method)</li>
	  						<li>Key findings from Interview/Survey</li>
	  						<li>Key findings from corpus analysis</li>
	  						<li>Compare/contrast findings</li>
	  						<li>Reflect and discuss key takeaways. (What was surprising and why? How will this knowledge impact technical communicators?)
	  					</ul>
	  				</li>
	  				<li>Contact information for your interview/survey subjects. Also, provide how you contacted the participant (email, phone, in person) and how long you interacted with the participant.</li>
	  				<li>5-7 minute presentation. I will not tell you what to present because you are graduate students. Make it interesting, know your audience, and impress us all.</li>
	  			</ol>
	  		<h4>Grading Criteria</h4>
	  			<ol>
	  				<li><b>Quality of insights drawn from interview/survey</b>: You will be graded on how well you synthesized and drew inferences from the responses from your participants. Synthesis means that you've found distinct patterns in the data and drew conclusions from those patterns. Your insights can be "obvious", but they should reflect thoughtful contemplation and analysis.</li>
	  				<li><b>Quality of insights drawn from corpus analysis</b>: You will be graded on how well you synthesized and drew inferences from the corpus data. Synthesis means that you've found distinct patterns in the data and drew conclusions from those patterns. Your insights can be "obvious", but they should reflect thoughtful contemplation and analysis.</li>
	  				<li><b>Writing quality</b>: Technical communicators are writers at heart. As such, you'll be graded on grammar, style, visual design, and genre conventions. If you aren't sure how to structure a formal report, research it.</li>
	  				<li><b>Quality of presentation</b>: You'll be graded on your presentation style and content. The style should reflect thoughtful planning. The content should reveal a thoughtful analysis and general interest in the topic.</li>
	  			</ol>
	  		<h3>Project 2 - XML Database and HTML Transformation</h3>
	  			<h4>Purpose</h4>
	  				<p>The purpose of this project is to introduce you to source literacies in technical communication. You will work with data at all phases for the data lifecycle. This includes 1) marking up raw data (XML), 2) processing the data (XSLT), and 3) outputting the data in a usable format (HTML/CSS) then You will be required to markup a dataset (of your choosing) in XML. You will then be required to transform the XML into an HTML table or list using XSLT. Finally, you'll be required to apply minimal styles to the table using CSS.</p>
	  			<h4>Deliverables and Requirements</h4>
	  				<ol>
	  					<li><b>XML database file</b>: You'll be required to create a well-formed, fully validated, XML database file with a minimum of 20 full entries (20 parent nodes). Feel free to work with a larger dataset though. It is your responsibility to select a dataset. If you are having trouble, it is your responsibility to meet with me during my office hours.</li>
	  					<li><b>XSLT stylesheet</b>: You are required to create a well-formed, XSLT stylesheet that renders the XML file in a browser as an HTML table. You may research how to do this and/or alter existing solutions you find. If you choose to alter an existing solution, you'll be asked to defend and explain your XSLT choices to ensure you understand what the code is doing.</li>
	  					<li><b>CSS stylesheet</b>: You are required to style your HTML table using a CSS file. You must include a minimum of 5 CSS styles. I don't care what you do to the table, but here's some suggestions: alternate row shading, remove table borders, change fonts, change spacing between cells, etc.</li>
	  					<li><b>Reflection paper</b>: A 500-750 word reflection paper of your experience with this project. Be sure to include rationale for your tagging system and hierarchy. Also, discuss explicit rationale about why your tagging/hierarchy meets specific user needs. Because your are in graduate school, I trust you can determine what to else include and I won't provide you with an explicit outline.</li>
	  				</ol>
	  			<h4>Extra Credit Opportunities</h4>
	  				<p>Because this is a digital literacy course, you are encouraged to learn and apply technical knowledge on your own. As such, you can be awarded up to 10 additional points on the project. These opportunities are for students who have a strong handle on HTML/CSS/XML/XSLT and feel comfortable exploring on their own. </p>
	  				<ol>
	  					<li><b>Sortable Table (1-5 points)</b>: Implement javascript into your table to make the columns sortable. You may use existing solutions. However, you'll be asked to defend or explain those solutions</li>
	  					<li><b>Full HTML Transformation (1-5 points)</b>: While you're not required to transform your XML into an HTML page, you have the opportunity to earn extra credit by using a programming language (javscript is probably easiest. HINT: see W3Schools for a template) to create an actual .html page from your XML database.</li>
	  					<li><b>Additional HTML/CSS (1-5 points)</b>: You have the option to integrate your HTML table into a larger HTML page. For instance, you can add a full-blown header, nav bar, footer and put the table into the page.</li>
	  				</ol>
	  			<h4>Grading Criteria</h4>
	  				<ol>
	  					<li><b>Well-formed XML</b>: Your XML is well-formed and logical. It must have a tree structure and be fully-validated. See W3Schools for an XML validator.</li>
	  					<li><b>Well-Written XML</b>: Your XML database contains semantic tags that are logical and clearly describe the content for which you are marking up.</li>
	  					<li><b>XSLT is fully-functional</b>: Your XSLT works and outputs your dataset into an HTML table. It contains correct syntax and is properly formatted.</li>
	  					<li><b>Well-written CSS</b>: CSS applies at least 5 styles to your HTML table. It is well-written and fully validated. </li>
	  					<li><b>Quality of reflection paper.</b>: You'll be graded on grammar, style, and visual design of your reflection. Additionally, your paper should reflect thoughtful contemplation.</li> 
	  					<li><b>Your best effort</b>: You put forth your absolute best effort to complete this project, regardless of your prior coding experience. You exhibited a clear effort in reseraching and applying knowledge on your own.</li>
	  				</ol>
	  		<h3>Project 3 - Persuasive Memo to Multiple Stakeholders</h3>
	  			<h4>Purpose</h4>
	  				<p>Technical communicators must be able to articulate their value to a variety of technical and non-technical stakeholders. This project is intended to expose you to the importance of persuasively communicating about technical topics. To successfully complete this project, you'll have to apply principles of technical communication literacy (using the language of technical communicator for multiple stakeholders), information literacy (being able to research and authoritatively communicate your research), and digital literacy (being able to competently use a new interface and describe its value to multiple stakeholders).</p>
	  				<p>With this in mind, you'll be required to persuade three distinct stakeholders to adopt MadCap Flare as your authoring platform</p>
	  			<h4>Deliverables and Requirements</h4>
	  				<ol>
	  					<li><b>Memo to Technical Communication Project Manager</b>: You will write a 500-750 word memo to your direct manager: Tom Johnson. Currently, you work in a department of 5 technical communicators (including you). You use Microsoft Word for authoring and a dedicated web writer converts the content to HTML for use on the web. While your manager has a strong understanding of single sourcing and modular authoring, he is not fully convinced it is worth changing entire work processes.</li>
	  					<li><b>Memo to Computer Engineering Project Manager</b>: You will write a 500-750 word memo to the computer engineering project manager: Jessica Smith. While she is less concnerned about the logisitics of switching to a new software and work process, she is concerned how changing to MadCap flare will impact (and benefit) her software engineers. She has a basic understanding of the benefits of single sourcing and modular authoring, but isn't sure how it will benefit her and her engineers.</li>
	  					<li><b>Memo to VP for Software Development</b>: You will write a 500-750 word memo to the VP for Software Development: Charissa Abraham. Her primary interest is, of course, the monetary implications of the changing to MadCap Flare. She has no previous knowledge of single sourcing and modular authoring and how it relates to time and human resource allocation.</li>
	  				</ol>
	  			<h4>Grading Criteria</h4>
	  				<ol>
	  					<li><b>Writing quality</b>: Technical communicators are writers at heart. As such, you'll be graded on grammar, style, visual design, and genre conventions. If you aren't sure how to structure a memo research it.</li>
	  					<li><b>Persuasiveness</b>: You'll be graded on the quality of the explicit arguments you make to each stakeholder. Your arguments will be graded based on their inclusion of a logical line of reasoning, appropriate use of evidence, and connection to your overall argument.</li>
	  					<li><b>Audience appropriateness</b>: Each memo should contain different arguments based on your assessment of audience needs, attitudes, and preferences. Even when arguments are the same across audiences, you should to present the argument in different ways when appropriate.</li>
	  					<li><b>Effort and research</b>: You must clearly exhibit that you've researched MadCap Flare in a comprehensive way. Comprhensive research is reflected in the types of arguments you make and the overall evidence you present.</li>
	  					<li><b>Accuracy of Information</b>: You will be communicating information about a technical product that you've never used. Therefore, you must ensure that all of your information is completely accurate.</li>
	  				</ol>
	  			<h3>Project 4 - Group Project: Author a Set of Procedures in MadCap Flare</h3>
	  				<h4>Purpose</h4>
	  					<p>The purpose of this project is to allow you to explore and become literate using a highly-used technical communication authoring software. It is, of course, less important that you master MadCap Flare. Instead, I hope you can apply your working knowledge of XML to easily navigate and learn to use the software only as much as necessary.</p>
	  				<h4>Deliverables and Requirements</h4>
	  					<ol>
	  						<li><b>Hand-written XML Procedure</b>: Before ever entering the world of Flare, I'm going to require you to markup your procedure in XML using a simple text editor. Your procedure must be technical in nature and must include at least one sub-level of procedures (e.g., Transforming an XML document might be split into two sub-levels: 1) XSLT Transformation and 2) CSS styling).</li>
	  						<li><b>XML document imported into Flare</b>: You'll import your XML document into Flare.</li>
	  						<li><b>HTML/CSS Output of XML Procedure</b>: Output and style your procedure using MadCap Flare. You must alter the CSS to style your procedure in a way that adheres to your design sensibilities as a technical communicator.</li>
	  						<li><b>PDF output of your XML Procedure</b> Output and style your procedure using MadCap Flare.</li>
	  						<li><b>Reflection paper</b>: Write a 500-750 word reflection that covers the key advantages of using Flare. Also discuss what was easy/difficult in learning to use Flare. Reflect in any other way you feel led.</li>
	  					</ol>
	  				<h4>Grading Criteria</h4>
	  					<ol>
	  						<li><b>Quality of Procedures</b>: Procedures are written in a clear and easy-to-follow manner. They are accurate and contain all relevant detail.</li>
	  						<li><b>Well-formed XML</b>: Your XML document is well-formed and contains no formatting errors. The XML utilizes tags that are semantic and describe the content accurately and vividly.</li>
	  						<li><b>MadCap Flare Output</b>: You were able to use basic features of Flare to output two distinct types of documents. Your styles are distinct for each of the outputs.</li>
	  						<li><b>Visual Design of Documents</b>: You altered stylesheets in Flare to create high-quality visual output that adheres to principles of design.</li>
	  						<li><b>Effort in learning and using Flare</b>: Your effort will be assessed based on the features utilized in creating your Flare documents.</li>
	  					</ol>
	  				<h3>Project 5 - Graduate-level Discussion Facilitator (in teams of 2)</h3>
	  					<h4>Description</h4>
	  						<p>In teams of 2, you will prepare a 20-30 minute discussion on the topic you are assigned to. Everyone in the class will be assigned a graduate-level academic reading by me. In addition to this, you will assign one more academic reading for the class.</p>
	  					<h4>Deliverables and Requirements</h4>
	  						<ol>
	  							<li><b>List of Discussion Questions</b>: You must turn in a written list of discussion questions.</li>
	  							<li><b>Visual Aid</b>: You must create and turn in a visual aid to go along with your discussion. This could be a presentation file, but more likely will be a 1-page worksheet that summarizes your discussion and includes discussion questions.</li>
	  						</ol>
	  					<h4>Grading Criteria</h4>
	  						<ol>
	  							<li><b>Level of Preparation</b>: You will be graded on how well prepared your team is to facilitate the class discusion. This means you have a strong grasp on the content of the articles and are able to lead the discussion in meaningful directions.</li>
	  							<li><b>Quality of discussion questions</b>: The questions evoke thought and drive a meaningful discussion. You clearly put forth effort into constructing thoughtful questions that prove you have a strong handle on the content of the articles.</li>
	  						</ol>
